# Vim Learning progress/recap

Here I will write an overview of the features I've learned about in vim and recap on the most useful tips and tricks learned so far.

I will also cover some configurations of my simple vimrc although I am trying to have it as organized as possible. 
# VIMRC
## Plugins
Plugins used in this vimrc are: 

- Ultisnips: Lets you create snippets for different file formats.
Look at the repository [here] (https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)

- Solarized theme: Seems to be one of the most popular themes.

- Airline: Gives a nice look to the status bar in vim. Its a replacement of an
older plugin called Powerline, take a look at the repository [here] (https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

- Emmet: To do HTML templating very fast.

- NerdTree: Power Vim with directory navigation.

- Hoogle: Lets you use the Hoogle search engine to lookup Haskell functions and types.

# Vim useful commands

Some of the features I've loved most learning Vim:

Executing external commands from withing Vim. This is done typing **:!**someProgram
this lets you compile programs easily, or do anything else. For example convert markdown to html with pandoc.
